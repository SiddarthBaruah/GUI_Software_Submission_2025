# GUI_Software_Submission_2025

```
First I started by creating the dashboard with the streamlit module. Then, added the menu bar with sorting and filtering options and displaying all the pod details. For locating the pods, I used st.map function with the latitudes and longitudes of the places. Then I used UPIs for getting the weather conditions and suggesting the speeds. Similarly, I also used json API for fetching the random facts.
For the FACTS part, I used the wikipedia and fetched the contents fromm it. For taking the facts from the whole content, I used keywords like, first, fastest, unique and similar keywords, used split function and  extracted it.

Required modules:
streamlit
pandas
numpy
requests
random
Run the code and we get a code like "streamlit run <location>". Run it in the cmd prompt and it will open it in the browser.
