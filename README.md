# GUI_Software_Submission_2025
First I coded the weather function
Then the pod details are entered(I first linked excel file containing pod details to it but as all the stuff how it works can't be seen didn't do it)
Created a function for fun facts
Cropped and inserted image
Energy tip which displays on opening the app(below image)
Heading
Pod tracker(heading)
Filters and sorting based on requirement
after applying filters it shows all the filtered pods with their details
Then a Map showing pod locations with default locations currently is displayed
Each pod is displayed with seperate colored tags on map and color repesenting each pod is mentioned above the map
CSS Styles for the next weather displaying section
On entering latitude and longitude of the location and clicking button below it, then it will display the weather conditions with speed warnings based on the weather.
Then pod comparison table, on selecting two pods using selectbox it will display their corresponding values in a comparison table.
Comparison table CSS styles
Transportation fun facts
This is the end.
